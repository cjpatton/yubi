\begin{abstract}
  The aim of \emph{two-factor authentication} is to tie a user's identity to
  something they \emph{know} (their password) and something they \emph{have} so
  that the attacker requires both in order to impersonate them.
  %
  The latter is often realized using a ``hardware token,'' a physical device
  that interacts with the server to authenticate the user.
  %
  \emph{YubiKey}, the flagship product of Yubico, is a low-cost, USB-enabled
  hardware token capable of supporting a variety of industry standard protocols.
  %
  Each token also supports \emph{Yubico OTP} (``one-time password''), a simple
  protocol based on symmetric-key cryptography that is designed to work
  out-of-the-box without the need to install code on the client.
  %
  But in terms of usability, this ease-of-deployment comes at a significant
  cost: we find that a YubiKey can only be used to authenticate to one service
  securely.
  %
  This work considers means by which a YubiKey may be used securely with many
  services, while keeping deployment complexity at a minimum.
  %
  Going further, we propose a redesign of the token that would
  make the hardware platform useful for a wide variety of applications beyond
  OTP-based authentication.
